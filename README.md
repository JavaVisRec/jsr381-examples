# JSR 381 Examples
These examples are created to help you through the VisRec API even better. 
Most of these examples are covered in our "Getting Started" document which 
we published at

https://github.com/JavaVisRec/visrec-api/wiki/Getting-Started-Guide. 

We highly recommend you to read that article especially if you're a beginner to machine learning but it's not mandatory 
to read that document get started.

## About VisRec API 

The Visual Recognition API JSR #381 is a software development standard recognized by the Java Community Process (JCP) that simplifies and standardizes a set of APIs familiar to Java developers for classifying and recognizing objects in images using machine learning. Beside classes specific for visual recognition tasks, it provides general abstractions for machine learning tasks like classification, regression and data set, and reusable design which can be applied for machine learning systems in other domains.
At the current stage it provides basic hello world examples for supported machine learning tasks (classification and regression) and image classification.
